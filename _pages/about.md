I am a Computer Science graduate student at Bilkent University, where I also completed my undergraduate degree with a 3.7 CGPA as a High Honor student. My research focuses on applying deep learning and machine learning techniques to bioinformatics and genomics.

Research Interests
======
My primary research area is in developing AI/ML models for genomics, particularly:
- Copy number variant (CNV) and structural variant (SV) detection from whole exome sequencing data
- Privacy-preserving federated learning for healthcare applications
- Deep learning applications in bioinformatics

I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant at the Cicek Lab at Bilkent University, working under the supervision of Dr. Ercument Cicek. I'm developing novel approaches for CNV calling that outperform existing methods, with a paper currently in submission.

Professional Experience
======
Beyond academia, I have industry experience as an Algorithm Engineer at Getir, where I worked on optimization problems including vehicle routing and delivery estimation. I developed machine learning pipelines that improved ETA prediction performance by over 30% and reduced early/late deliveries by 10%.

I also have full-stack development experience, having built hospital administration systems and web applications used by hundreds of healthcare facilities across Turkey.

Technical Background
======
My technical expertise spans:
- Deep Learning frameworks (PyTorch)
- Backend development (Python, Java, Springboot, Django, FastAPI, NodeJS)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP)
- Optimization algorithms (Google OR Tools)
- Database systems (SQL, MongoDB, Redis)

Awards & Recognition
======
- Technical Service Award from Bilkent University (2024) for contributions to the department's internship system
- Career Days Award from Dream Games (2025)
- Comprehensive + Full Scholarship at Bilkent University
- Ranked 20th in Department, 59th in National University Exam among 2.5+ million students
