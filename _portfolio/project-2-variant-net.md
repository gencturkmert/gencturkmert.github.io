Implemented an enhanced Deep Graph Infomax model integrated with LLAMA 3-8B for analyzing gene variant and disease relationships on a large-scale graph dataset.

**Technologies Used:**
- Deep Learning: PyTorch, Graph Neural Networks
- Large Language Model: LLAMA 3-8B
- Database: Neo4j (managing 300M nodes)
- Focus Areas: Graph representation learning, medical semantics, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**Key Features:**
- Processed and analyzed a massive graph dataset with 300 million nodes stored in Neo4j
- Improved LLM's understanding of medical semantics through graph-based learning
- Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities on genomic data
- Combined traditional graph learning methods with modern LLM architectures

**Impact:**
This project bridges the gap between graph-based genomic knowledge and large language models, enabling more accurate interpretation of genetic variants and their relationships to diseases. The enhanced model demonstrates improved performance in understanding complex medical and genomic concepts.

**Research Applications:**
The techniques developed in this project have potential applications in:
- Clinical variant interpretation
- Drug discovery and repurposing
- Personalized medicine
- Biomedical knowledge extraction
