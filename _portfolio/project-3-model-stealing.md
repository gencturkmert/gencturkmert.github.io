Developing an algorithm to improve query-based model stealing attacks using a novel approach that combines disagreement metrics and similarity scores with contrastive learning techniques.

**Research Focus:**
This project explores the security vulnerabilities of machine learning models through query-based attacks, with the goal of understanding and improving defenses against model theft.

**Key Approach:**
- Utilizes disagreement scores between models to identify informative queries
- Employs similarity metrics to select diverse and representative query points
- Integrates contrastive learning approaches for more effective query selection
- Focuses on maximizing information extraction while minimizing query count

**Technical Innovation:**
The heuristic-based query selection strategy significantly reduces the number of queries needed to steal a model while maintaining high fidelity in the stolen model's performance. This work has important implications for:
- Understanding ML model vulnerabilities
- Developing better model protection techniques
- Improving adversarial robustness
- Designing query detection and prevention systems

**Status:** Ongoing research project
