This work presents a privacy-preserving approach to data normalization in federated learning using homomorphic encryption. We evaluate various normalization techniques across heterogeneous federated learning scenarios, with a particular focus on healthcare applications.

Data normalization is critical in federated learning, especially when dealing with non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data across different clients. Our approach enables secure computation of normalization statistics without exposing raw data, maintaining privacy guarantees while improving model performance.

We experimented with over 6000 federated network configurations to thoroughly analyze the effects of different normalization strategies under various non-IID data distributions.

**Status:** In submission to peer-reviewed conference/journal
