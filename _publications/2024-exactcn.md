Deep learning method for exact copy number estimation from whole exome sequencing data, combining CNNs and transformers. This work achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 32% mean absolute error (MAE) reduction compared to existing methods.

The model addresses the challenging problem of predicting exact copy numbers from WES data, which has important applications in cancer genomics and clinical diagnostics. By combining convolutional neural networks with transformer architectures, we can capture both local sequence features and long-range dependencies in the data.
